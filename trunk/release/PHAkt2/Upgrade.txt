Dreamweaver MX 6.0 generates a javascript errors when creating some dynamic elements like recordset navigation bars. In the 2.1.0 version of PHAkt, InterAKT had corrected this problem by overwriting the "dwscriptsExtData.js" file with a modified version.

Macromedia has later corrected this problem in the  Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 6.1 Updater and therefore InterAKT has eliminated the modified "dwscriptsExtData.js" from the last versions of it's products.

However, in order to be sure that Dreamweaver MX and PHAkt will function properly, please follow the following steps:

Step 1:   If you are using a Microsoft Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows XP, please delete the "dwscriptsExtData.js" file from the "Configuration\Shared\Common\Scripts\" folder placed in the current user "c:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Macromedia\Dreamweaver MX" folder.
					
          If your are using Microsoft Windows 98 or older please skip this step.
          If your are using  Mac OS please skip this step.

Step 2:   Install the Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 6.1 Updater.

Step 3:   Uninstall the PHAkt older version using the Macromedia Extension Manager

Step 4:   Install the current PHAkt2 version included in this package

Step 5:   In each existing site that will be edited using the current PHAkt2 version, you MUST delete the "adodb" folder and then edit a connection. PHAkt2 will recreate this folder using the updated functions. Then you have to upload the new site version on the websever.

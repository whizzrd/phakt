PHAkt2 is a free and complex implementation of PHP server model for the Dreamweaver MX environment. It adds a lot of improvements over the PHP_MySQL server model that ships with Dreamweaver:
- Support for multiple databases in a transparent way
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MsSQL date locales
- User authentication Server Behaviors
- Master/Detail Server Behaviors
- Go to detail Page Server behaviors
- Improved code generation (all reusable code is kept in functions.inc.php)
- Multiple and extensible recordset support.
- IIS and Apache 2 support by using absolute redirects.

The release numbering convention we're using is major.minor.micro. Major indicates a large change in the core package, minor a significant amount of feature addition/modification(even - stable version, odd - unstable), micro mostly for bug fixes.

We'd appreciate an email letting us know if you find this extensions useful.

We also design and sell a suite of commercial products based on PHAkt, that are
created to increase web developer's productivity. Find more about our products at: http://www.interakt.ro/products/

We're open to suggestions for improvement in the generated code or design.
